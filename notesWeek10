Neural Networks
Embed lots of perceptron-like nodes in more complex networks
Allows us to learn non linear functions
Use backpropagation feedback to learn parameters; use forward propagation to make predictions
Each node has a input function (typically summing weights), and has an activation function
Gradient descent a type of backpropagation

Data Ethics / Data dignity
Social media and video games are designed to be addicting

Three Principles from Belmont Report
Respect for person: Participation must be completely voluntary and based on full understanding of what is involved
