If X and Y are independent, then
P(X,Y) = P(X)P(Y)

Conditional independence
X and Y are conditionally independent given Z, if:
P(X|Y, Z) = P(X|Z) or P(X, Y|Z) = P(X|Z)P(Y|Z)

Cavity, Tootache, Catch
Knowing you have a toothache or catch makes it more likely the other will happen, so not independent
If I have a cavity, probability the probe catches on it doesn't depend on whether I have a tootache
P(catch | tootache, cavity) = P(catch|cavity)


Sometimes things start off as independent but they are not conditionally independent
Conditional dependence
P(Battery, Gas, Start)
Are battery and gas independent. Yes.
However if car doesn't start, probability the battery is dead DOES depend on if gas tank is empty
Battery and Gas are NOT conditionally independent given Start


Cause and Effect
Medical Diagnosis and Causality
What is the best way to predict whether someone is likely to have a heart attack?
	Whether they take blood thinners?
	Does that mean blood thinners cause heart attacks?
		No
		Patients who are high risk tend to take blood thinners (which reduces their risk by a bit)
		Patients who are low risk do not
		Patients who take blood thinners have more heart attacks than those who don't so it appears as if the blood thinners cause heart attacks when they actually reduce the risk for those patients

Study said chocolate consumption lowered risk of heart disease
Is there any relation between chocolate consumption and heart disease?

P(Cardiovascular disease | Chocolate) does not equal P(Cardiovasucular Disease | not Chocolate)
There is a correlation

What is correlation?
	Tendency for two values or variables to change together, in either the same or the opposite way
Correlation is any statistical relationship, whether causual or not, between two random variables
	May indicate any type of association
	In statistics, usually refers to the degree to which a pair of variables are linearly related
Super useful because they can be indicate a predictive relationship that can be exploited in practice

Does chocolate consumption lead to a reduction in heart disease? (Causuality)
This question is often hard to answer
"The study doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between chocolate and reduced risk of heart disease and stroke"

Causality
Definition: Influence by which one event, process, state, or object (a cause) contributes to the production of another event, process, state, or object (an effect) where the cause is partly responsible for the effect, and the effect 
is partly dependent on the cause. 
In general a process has many causes, which are also called causal factors
An effect can in turn be a cause of, or causal factor for, many other effects, which all lie in the future

What is causual manipulation?
"Causation implies that by varying one factor, I can make another vary"

Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
In a RCT, a group of subjects is randomlypartitionted into the control group and a treatment group
Participants do not know which group they were assigned, and heither do the people administering the trial (double-blind design)
Treatment group receives treament, control group received placebo
An outcome variable is measured for all subjects

Trying to make it so that in the experiment every single variable is the same except one variable, which is the one you control to see what happens

Something similar that is commonly used is A/B testing
A way to compare two versions of something to figure out which performs better
	Often associated with websites and apps
Started in 1920s with farmers, wondering what would happen if they put more fertilizer on land

Why randomized trials can be hard
Might be physicall or legally impossible, too costly, too dangerous
Experimental setting may be random in theory, true randomness can be very hard to achieve in practice
Many ethical and moral issues involved: for example, whether effective treatment may be withheld from the control group
	Generally give the best treatment currently available to control group rather than just giving them nothing
In some settings hard to make a placebo for it, how to realistically fake a surgery
Recruitment of participants to a particular trial may be too difficult
Too few people might have a certain disease and be available for investigation

If treatment and control groups have systematic difference other than treatment, then it might be difficult to identify causality
Such differences are often present in observational studies
When they lead researchers astray, they are called confounding factors


Correlation vs Causation and Confounders
Correlation
If X and Y are positively correlated, then observing high X means we shoulds ee high Y

Causation
If X and Y are causally connected, then if I manipulate the value of X, keeping everything else concstant, the value of Y will change

Confounder
Correlation is often due to confounding latent variable that is a hidden cause of both X and Y

Ice cream sales are positively correlated
	Shut down ice cream stores and crime should go down right?
It turns out both of thse go up in the summer

Biased Data (revisited)
Very important skill to develop as machine learner to be able to know if data might be flawed

Selection bias
OCcurs when there are systematic differences between subsets of data, such that the subset is not representative of overall population
In clinical trials this can happen at multiple stages
In observational data, there is very likely some selection bias, and it is extremely important to think through this aspect carefully
Thinking about underlying causal process often helps one recognize when there may be selection bias

Selection Bias Types
1. Sampling Bias
	Caused by non-random sampling of population
	When this bias occurs, sample attributes are systematically different from actual population values
	Produces a distorted view of a population
	Can occur when some subsets are excluded from research sample for one reason or the other
		Leads to imbalanced representation of the different subgroups in the sample population
	Ensuring data is randomly sampled is most effective strategy to avoid this
		This is imppractical in many cases
		Important to be aware that convience, using observational data rather than randomly sampled data, might exclude some variables from the systematic investigation
2. Exclusion Bias
	Happens when researcher intentionally removes some subgroups from the sample population
3. Attrition Bias
	Happens when some research participants exit the study while it's still ongoing
	If this happens differentially for different subpopulations, this affects the quality of the outcomes arrived at in the end

Correlation may be an indication of potential causation, but it does not guarantee that is the case


Module 5: Data Processing, Warngling, and Manipulation
Last module was about math or science of ML
This module is art of ML

Overview of challenges
Attribute value ambiguity
Values can be represented in ambiguous ways
	Enter the color of your eyes: Brown, brown, browne, brownish, dark brown, greenish brown
	Numbers: 25%, 0.25, 25/100]
	Unknown value: null, NaN, "", "N/A", "unknown", 0, -1, -3, -9
Name ambiguity
	Michael Jordan is a famous basketball player, but he isn't the only person named Michael Jordan
	Happens when one string corresponds to more than one thing
Data entry errors
Missing values
Changing attributes
	If people enter addresses in database and they move, need to updated address but how does that happen
Data Formatting
	Multiple ways to write the same date
Abbrevations / Data Truncation
	What kind of abbreviations do people use when entering data

Need to clean data to make sure data types are the same, can't work with data of different data types

String Encoding
Bit-level representation of strings
ASCII was used back in the day, only 128 possible characters
UTF-8 is variable-length character capable of encoding all 1,1112,064 valid characters using one to four bytes
	Backwards compatible with UTF-8
UTF-8 is more common and should be used by default

File Formats
Human-readable
Excel - Theoretically also machine readable but has a lot of edge cases
PDF - Easy for humans to read, hard to transcribe data
Word

Machine-Readable
Comma-seperated values (CSV) - Most basic type, also TSV (tab seperated)
Extensible Markup Language (XML) - Markup language for storing and transporting data; defined by World Wide Web Consortium
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) - Clean, easy to parse, most commonly used format

Transcribing from human readable to machine readable data can be a pain
Try to avoid if you can


Data Cleaning Process
Well known data processing phrase: "Garbage in, garbage out"
Means your insight, analysis, and predictions are only as good as the data you're using to get them

An ideal, high-quality data set is: accurate, complete, consistent, relevant, valid, timely, and uniform
How to get high quality data?
	Gather it well
	Fix it as best as you can

Data Cleaning Process
Import data, merge data sets, rebuild missing data, standardization, normalization, deduplication, verification & enrichment, export data
Other orders of doing this too

Duplicates and Irrelevent Data
Remove duplicates
	Duplicate records can appear for various reasons (data entry erros, merging multiple data sources, multiple patient visits, name ambiquity)
	Important to understand when duplicates make sense versus when they are errors and need to be removed (or collapsed/combined)
Remove irrelevant data
	Previously collected data often includes observations aren't relevent to current problem (too old, refers to diff subpopulation, doesn't satisfy constraints of particular investigation)

Identifying and Repairing Incorrect data
Understanding when data is incorrect (and how to fix it) often requires domain knowledge or talking with domain experts
Inspecting data is important
height
Does value of -1.0 or 8.0 ft make sense? No

Structural Errors
Refers to a wide variety of formatting and naming inconsistences that need to be addressed in order for ML algorithms to work correctly
When data is multi-relational, there are often structural integrity constraints that must be checked
	In this example might want to make sure every student has at least one major

Missing Data
Strategies:
	Drop data that has missing values
	Data imputation: Replace missing values with average feature value (mean or mode)
		Data interpolation: Assume functional form (e.g. linear) and use appropriate method (e.g. linear regression)
Important issue: missing data mechanisms

Missing data mechanisms
Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
	Means there is no relationship between missingness of data and any values, observed or missing
	Missing values are random subset of data
	Nothing systematic that makes some data more likely to be missing than others
Missing at Random (MAR)
	Systematic relationship between the propensity of the missing values and the observed data, but not the missing data
	Whether observation is missing has nothing to do with missing values, but it does have to do with the values of an individual's observed variables
Missing Not at Random (MNAR)
	Means there is a relationship between the propensity of a value to be missing and its value
	For example, older people may be less likely to report their age, or people with lower education levels may be more likely to omit the education level field
